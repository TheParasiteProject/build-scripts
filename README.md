# Build-Scripts

Sync, build script for TheParasiteProject.<br>
Only supports Ubuntu 23.04 and up, Debian, Arch Linux.<br>
These are not fancy scripts. Just for personal use :P

## Desc

* Edit `options.sh` to match your own needs.
* Although there's args exist, you can hardcoded those options on `options.sh`<br>
  (e.g. Setting `VERBOSE=true` on `options.sh` will have same effect with arg `-v`)

## sync.sh

* Sync rom sources.
* Automatically install all dependancies.
* If there're any manifests files found under `.configs/additional-manifests` dir,<br>
  those files will be copied under `.repo/local_manifests`.
* If there're any manifests files found under `.configs/device-manifests`: dir,<br>
  those files will be copied under `.repo/local_manifests`.<br>
  Make sure `device-manifests` and `additional-manifests` have not same file name or contents.
* If there're no vars set, will use default values.
* If source dir already exists, it will update repos.

You can find example device-manifests from [our Project's devices repo](https://github.com/TheParasiteProject-Devices/device-manifests).

### Vars

## patch.sh

* Apply patches to rom sources.

  You need to follow the naming style. (build/soong -> build+soong)

* DEVICE: Target device of rom to build.
  `DEVICE=common`.<br>
* BUILDTYPE: Build type of rom to build. 
  e.g. `BUILDTYPE=user`.<br>

* OUT_FILE: Output file names after built.<br>
  e.g. `OUT_FILE="boot.img recovery.img"`
* LUNCHCOMMAND: Lunch command of rom to build.
